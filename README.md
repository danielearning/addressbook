# Single Page Application (SPA) Address book (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

Quoting from the requirements page:

    There shuold be one view here all contacts are listed.
    There should be another view to add, delete and edit contacts.
    The data should be persisted (on the client), and loaded again when the application starts.
    Add fitting validation to the different input fields.

    Even though this is a small project, structure and architecture should mimic a large project.
    The code should obviusly follow best practises (DRY, maintainable, tesable, etc.).
    Feel free to depend on any frameworks/libraries you think is suitable using NPM/Bower.
    We want the code you submit to be written by you, so don’t use skelletons/generators.
    Make sure the application work on Node 5.x, NPM 3.x and in latest Chrome and Firefox.

## Notes

Despite the "don't use skelletons/generators" in the requirements, 
the specific questions of the interviewer about AngularJS and the listing 
of BetIt tools in the challenge description make me really wanting to make 
a project with AngularJS and all of the suggested tools, specially the testing ones.

In the end, it took me a little bit more than expected.
